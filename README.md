# My Very First Web Page

## Welcome!!!

This is my ***very FISRT*** website since I have started to study in Code Institute. This website was made in order for me to learn:
   * how to create a webpage with *HyperText Mmarkup Language* - **HTML**
   * how to put a style to it with *Cascadian Style Sheet* - **CSS**
   * how to create a local **Git** repository to track the changes in my files using a *Code-Line Interface* - **CLI**
   * how to create a remote repository so project is available for public on **GitHub**
   
Each of the website pages show the platforms I will be using for each of my projects and contains __text__ and **image** links to Wikipedia.

### What I did to make it happen.

1. First I had to create an account in [_Cloud9_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud9_IDE) and then make a workspace for my project.
   * Cloud9 is an online integrated development environment also called *the editor* which doesn't require additional software instalation.

***
2. Once I had everything set up I made files for each of the pages and wrote the code using [_HTML5_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) language. 
   * HTML is the standard markup language to create websites.

***

3. Next step was to style my website using [_CSS_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) language - I created folder and file for slyling and wrote the code.
   * CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.
   * ***
4. After that I linked the [_HTML5_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [_CSS_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) files together in order to apply the styles to the pages.

5. Next step was to make a [_Git_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repositary using [_CLI_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) to store my code files localy. This will allow me to compare and control different version of my code when I make changes to it.
   * CLI is the means of communication with a computer program by issuing commands using text lines (command lines)
   * Git  is a system used to track changes in computer files - version control
   * ***

6. Then I made an account in [_GitHub_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) so I can make a remote repository - this makes my project and code visible to public.
   * Git Hub is a web based service for version control using _Git_ which hosts open-source software projects.
